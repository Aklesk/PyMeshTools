# PyMeshTools
A set of tools designed for easy lightweight editing of Lightwave .obj files. At the moment the main focus is the ability to slice a model at a given height, delete the lower portion of the model, and fill the hole.

## Version 0.5
Functionality is very limited, but tools seem robust enough.
No support for vertex normals.
No support for mtl files.
No support for compound shapes.
